A 2D Animation scene

This project is a simulation of fireworks that implements gravity and wind. It uses three separate classes: a fireworks class, a smoke class and a particle/particle explosion class. 

The fireworks are thrust into the air , slowly brought down by gravity,followed by smoke, and upon detonation, explode into particles that disseminate into the air.

Mason- Fireworks class and main program

Andrew - Smoke class and main program

Vineel - Particle/particle explosion classes.
